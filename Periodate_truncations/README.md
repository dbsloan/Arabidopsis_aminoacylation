# Periodate_truncations

Generating plots of misincorporation profiles for nuclear tRNA-IleTAT and plastid tRNA-LysTTT because they show periodate-specific truncations (using periodate and no-periodate control data from experiment 1).

Input files, R code, and output are included in the directory.

Variant calls for misincorporation profiles were generated with Perbase.
