#the following takes sets of input files and outputs a file that can be used in R to make mirrored bar plots for end mapping positions. It does the following.
#--replaces specified isodecoder names (in this case, eMet and iMet --> Met(e) and Met(i)
#--Excludes a list specialized genes (in this case, stem loops, 3 mito genes with too much cross mapping, and the Bacillus spike in)
#--Outputs TPM (divided by number of reps so that sum results in the average TPM when plotted)
#--Selected specified genome (plastid, mitochondrial, or nuclear)
#--sum isodecoders
#--Apply positive values for one group and negative values for another so that they can be plotted in a mirrored fashion

#the print_facet_axis_string.pl script was called using each of the output files from the above calls (6 separate runs). It prints out a long string that can be used to manually set the y axis limites for each facet in a ggplot in conjunction with the ggh4x package: https://teunbrand.github.io/ggh4x/reference/facetted_pos_scales.html



#generated plots in R (end_mapping_plots.r) with the following script. The long string of axis formatting for each was based on output from the above Perl script.
