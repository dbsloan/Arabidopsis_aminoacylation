# Arabidopsis_aminoacylation

## Summary

Analysis of [MSR-seq](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30261-3) datasets generated with periodate-treatment to infer aminoacylation status for tRNAs from Arabdidopsis thaliana.

The main workflow for read processing, mapping, and classification is described in the CCA_mapping_runs directory. The other directories are for specific analyses and plot generation.

## Raw Data Availability

Raw sequencing data can be found on NCBI SRA via [BioProject PRJNA1154980](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/PRJNA1154980).

## Protocol

A [detailed protocol](MSR-seq.protocol.pdf) used for data generation is available via this repository.
