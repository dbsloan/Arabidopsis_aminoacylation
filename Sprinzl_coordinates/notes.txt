#Downloaded all Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 tRNA genes (June 22, 2024) from plantRNA database: https://seve.ibmp.unistra.fr/plantrna/

#This produces an excel file with tRNA sequences partioned into their different regions: plantRNA-result.xls

#Manually modified to remove duplicates, generate a concatenated version of the sequence, and incorporate gene names matching the database in the current analysis: plantRNA.xlsx

#Also exported as a tsv file from excel and converted line breaks to linux (LF) with BBEdit: plantRNA.txt

#script to map each tRNA base onto a Sprinzl position.

perl plantRNA_to_Sprinzl.pl plantRNA.txt > Arabidopsis_Sprinzl.txt

#The above script flags some positions for manual checking. Made some updates to these: Arabidopsis_Sprinzl.mod.txt
